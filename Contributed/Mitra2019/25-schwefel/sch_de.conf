# This example comes from a benchmark problem in
# Gupta, A.; Mendes, P. An Overview of Network-Based and -Free Approaches for Stochastic Simulation of Biochemical Systems. Computation 2018, 6 (1), 9.
# who themselves got it from Blinov 2006. 
# For fitting, we generated simulated data based on the ground truth parameters used in the Gupta study.

# An adaptation of egfr_benchmark for use in our mutiple algs / multiple cores pipeline
