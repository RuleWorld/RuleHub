# ligand-receptor binding
# As a simplification, we consider a one-step binding mechanism.

# capture and release of (multivalent) antigen as well as the effects 
# of antigen-mediated receptor aggregation on the residence time of antigen
# on the cell surface. Recall that the antigen receptor is a long-lived 1:1
# complex of antigen-specific IgE and Fc&epsilon;RI, the high-affinity Fc
# receptor for IgE.

# As a simplification, we assume that the &beta; and &gamma; sites are 
# phosphorylated simultaneously as part of a single process. 
# The effective rate constant for phosphorylation is assumed to capture
# associaton of Lyn with receptors and the relationship between the abundance
# of cell-associated antigen and the extent of antigen-mediated receptor

# to liberate Ship1.
