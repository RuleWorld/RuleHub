## Description
A model of Rab5 and Rab7 activation and EGFR degradation in response to stimulation with EGF.

This model is supplementary material for the following manuscript in preparation:

Shideler T, Palsuledesai C, Suderman R, Mitra E, Cleyrat C, Hlavacek WS, Wandinger-Ness A. A High Dose of EGF Promotes EGFR Degradation by Increasing Rab7 Activity.
