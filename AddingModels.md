## Guidelines for adding new models.

1. Pick a directory, Published or Contributed.
2. Name is determined by either first author or the contributor, followed by the year of publication or contribution. If there is already a model in either section with that name, add another descriptive keyword (must start with a letter not a number) to the name, e.g., Blinov2006EGFR.
3. Make a directory with the name of the model in the corresponding section.
4. Put all model files and (optionally) associated scripts in this directory.
5. Create a README.md file in the directory based on the template provided in the corresponding model section (Published or Contributed).
6. If there are multiple model files/scripts, provide a table in the README.md file that gives a brief description of each. 
7. (optional) Provide additional annotation in each model file based on the annotation keywords provided in ...

## Guidelines for journal articles linking to RuleHub

When a new model is published in a journal and also uploaded to RuleHub, it is often useful to include a link to RuleHub in the journal article. To do so, we recommend obtaining a **permanent link**, such that the model version associated with the article will always be accessible, regardless of future changes to RuleHub. 

To obtain a permanent link, after uploading your final version to RuleHub, ask a RuleHub administrator (Eshan Mitra, [emitra@lanl.gov](mailto:emitra@lanl.gov)) to create a *tag* for the current RuleHub version. The tag name will consist of the current date, e.g. `2019Jun17`. Your permanent link will consist of this tag name in place of `master` in the URL of your model; for example: <https://github.com/RuleWorld/RuleHub/tree/2019Jun17/Published/Mitra2019>.
